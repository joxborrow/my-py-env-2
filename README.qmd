# MY-PY-ENV

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away there were statistical/programming packages where individual packages did not need to be individually installed and loaded. This environment file is meant to be a collection of common packages for analysis and data science. This README is meant to be the manual, linking to the documentation for each key package.

This "manual" is organized by topic. If you feel something should be added, please feel free to submit a pull request.
